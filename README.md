# CS3021 - Computer Architecture II

Repository for 3rd Year Computer Architecture II module.  
See "CS3021 Module Descriptor 2018-19.pdf" for details.  
  
This module focuses on the architecture of modern high performance microprocessor systems. Topics covered are procedure calling conventions, the architecture of RISC CPUs, instruction level pipelining, virtual memory, caches, multiprocessors, cache coherency and spin locks.  
This module examines the internal architecture of modern microprocessors, paying particular attention to issues that improve performance and to the close relationship between the hardware and the needs of the software.
